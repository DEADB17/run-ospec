* =run-ospec=

/A more flexible ospec runner./

[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/ospec][ospec]] is a tese testing framework that explicitly disallows test-space
configuration to encourage focus on testing, and to provide uniform test suites
across projects.

=run-ospec= is an alternative runner that allows to select which files will be
tested by =ospec=.

I wanted the flexibility to choose which tests to run with =ospec= while
migrating existing tests that used a different framework that relied on the same
naming convention.

If you are starting a new project and and ospec's naming convention works, you
should stick to it.

** =run-ospec= API

=run-ospec [fileRegexp] [rootDirectory]=

  files. Defaults to =/(?:^|\/)tests\/.*\.js$/=, ospec's default.
- =[rootDirectory]= /optional/ string to specify the root directory where the
